* The x7 Programming Language

x7 is a lisp I built to better understand programming languages and interpreters.

The standard library is being written in either x7 or rust for performance.

** TODOs

- [ ] Loading files / modules
- [ ] Test suite in the x7 language
  - [ ] (test res expr)



* Thanks

A big thanks to the [[https://github.com/Geal/nom][nom]] people (Geal et all) for having an s_expression example for my parser!
